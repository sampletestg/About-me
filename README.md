## 🚀 About Me  
I'm **Rupak**, an Electronics Engineering student who enjoys building systems where **software meets hardware**.  
I work mainly with **C/C++, MERN stack**, and **embedded systems**, and I’m actively diving into **Machine Learning and Deep Learning** to solve real-world problems.  

I believe in **learning by building**, writing clean code, and designing systems that scale—from circuits to cloud.
